Palimpsest License v0.8

Copyright (c) 2025 MAA Framework Contributors

## Preamble

A palimpsest is a manuscript page from which text has been scraped or washed
off so that it can be reused for another document. Traces of the original text
often remain visible, creating layers of meaning.

This license embodies the philosophy that software, like a palimpsest, is:
- **Layered**: Built upon previous work
- **Iterative**: Constantly rewritten and improved
- **Reversible**: Changes can be undone
- **Impermanent**: Nothing is final, everything evolves
- **Traceable**: History remains visible

## Grant of Rights

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions

### 1. Attribution
The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

### 2. Reversibility Acknowledgment
Derivative works should acknowledge the principle of reversibility - that
changes can and should be reversible where possible. This is a philosophical
stance, not a technical requirement.

### 3. History Preservation
When practical, preserve the history of changes (e.g., through version control).
This creates a "palimpsest effect" where layers of development remain visible.

### 4. Iteration Encouragement
This license encourages iteration and experimentation. Early releases,
prototypes, and work-in-progress are valued as much as "finished" products.

### 5. Impermanence Recognition
Acknowledge that software is never truly finished - it evolves, changes, and
eventually becomes obsolete. This impermanence is natural and healthy.

## Philosophy

This license is inspired by:

- **Palimpsests**: Ancient manuscripts reused and layered
- **Version Control**: Git's philosophy of traceable history
- **Agile Development**: Iteration over perfection
- **Buddhist Impermanence**: Nothing is permanent, everything changes
- **Open Source**: Collaborative, transparent, iterative development

## Compatibility

The Palimpsest License v0.8 is compatible with:

- MIT License
- Apache License 2.0
- BSD Licenses (2-clause and 3-clause)
- ISC License
- Other permissive open source licenses

It is intentionally similar to the MIT License in its legal terms, with
additional philosophical principles that guide (but do not legally constrain)
usage.

## Version

This is version 0.8 of the Palimpsest License, reflecting that the license
itself is iterative and subject to refinement. Version 1.0 will be released
after community feedback and real-world usage.

## Notes

This license is designed to be:
- **Legally clear**: Based on proven MIT License structure
- **Philosophically rich**: Embodies principles of iteration and reversibility
- **Practically permissive**: Does not impose technical burdens
- **Culturally aligned**: Matches open source development practices
- **Historically aware**: Acknowledges software's layered nature

previous thoughts, yet traces remain." - Adapted from philosophical tradition
