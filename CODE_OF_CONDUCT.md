# Code of Conduct

## 🤝 Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- **Accountability** for mistakes and learning from them

## 🛡️ Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 🌍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Participating in project-related discussions

## 📋 Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: conduct@maa-framework.org
- **GitLab**: [Confidential Issue](https://gitlab.com/maa-framework/6-the-foundation/aletheia/-/issues/new?issue[confidential]=true)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Confidentiality

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## 💚 Emotional Safety Framework

In addition to standard conduct guidelines, we recognize the importance of **emotional safety** in open source:

### Psychological Safety

- **Safe to experiment**: Contributors can try new ideas without fear of humiliation
- **Safe to fail**: Mistakes are learning opportunities, not grounds for punishment
- **Safe to dissent**: Disagreement is encouraged when done respectfully
- **Safe to be yourself**: Authentic expression is welcomed within professional boundaries

### Reversibility Culture

We embrace a culture where:

- **Experiments are encouraged**: Git makes everything reversible
- **Early feedback is valued**: Share work-in-progress for collaborative improvement
- **Iterations are normal**: First drafts are rarely perfect
- **Anxiety is reduced**: Knowing changes can be reverted reduces fear of contribution

### Emotional Temperature Monitoring

We encourage contributors to:

- **Take breaks**: Step away when frustrated or overwhelmed
- **Ask for help**: Request support when stuck or uncertain
- **Set boundaries**: Decline work that exceeds capacity
- **Practice self-care**: Prioritize wellbeing over deadlines

## 🎯 TPCF Alignment

This Code of Conduct aligns with the **Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)**:

- **Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox)**: Open contribution with quality standards
- **Graduated Trust**: Build trust through consistent positive contributions
- **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit guidelines for each perimeter level
