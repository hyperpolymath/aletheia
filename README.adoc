= Aletheia

> *Ἀλήθεια* (alētheia) - Greek: "truth", "disclosure", "unconcealment"

*Aletheia* is a zero-dependency Rust tool for verifying https://gitlab.com/maa-framework[Rhodium Standard Repository (RSR)] compliance. It helps maintainers ensure their repositories meet the rigorous standards for security, documentation, and operational excellence.

== Purpose

Aletheia verifies that repositories conform to RSR standards across multiple dimensions:

- *Documentation Completeness*: README, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, MAINTAINERS.md, CHANGELOG.md
- *Security Disclosure*: `.well-known/security.txt` (RFC 9116), `.well-known/ai.txt`, `.well-known/humans.txt`
- *Build System*: justfile, flake.nix, CI/CD configuration
- *Source Structure*: Proper organization of source code and tests

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/maa-framework/6-the-foundation/aletheia.git
cd aletheia

# Build the tool
cargo build --release

# Run verification on the current directory
cargo run

# Run verification on a specific repository
cargo run -- /path/to/repository

# Run with JSON output (for CI/CD)
cargo run -- --format json

# Run in quiet mode (only PASS/FAIL)
cargo run -- --quiet

# Run in verbose mode (detailed output)
cargo run -- --verbose

# Show help
cargo run -- --help

# Run tests
cargo test
----

== CLI Usage

[source]
----
aletheia [OPTIONS] [PATH]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help           Print help information
    -V, --version        Print version information
    -q, --quiet          Quiet mode (only outputs PASS or FAIL)
    -v, --verbose        Verbose mode (detailed output)
    --format <FORMAT>    Output format: human (default), json

EXIT CODES:
    0    All checks passed
    1    Compliance checks failed
    2    Security warning (critical)
    3    Invalid path provided
    4    Invalid arguments

== RSR Compliance Status

*Aletheia itself is RSR Bronze-level compliant:*

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Feature | Status

| *Type Safety* | Rust compile-time guarantees, zero unsafe blocks
| *Memory Safety* | Rust ownership model, no manual memory management
| *Zero Dependencies* | Only uses Rust standard library
| *Offline-First* | No network calls, works completely air-gapped
| *Test Coverage* | 10 unit tests + 18 integration tests (28 total)
| *Documentation* | All required docs present
| *Security-First* | RFC 9116 security.txt, vulnerability disclosure policy
| *Build System* | justfile for common operations, Nix for reproducibility
| *CI/CD* | Automated testing and verification (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions)
|===

== Architecture

Aletheia follows a simple, auditable architecture:

[source]

├── src/
│   └── main.rs          # Core implementation (~810 lines)
├── tests/
│   └── integration_tests.rs  # 18 integration tests

=== Design Principles

1. *Simplicity*: Single-file implementation, easy to audit
2. *Zero Trust*: No network dependencies, no external crates
3. *Type Safety*: Leverage Rust's type system for correctness
4. *Offline-First*: Works completely air-gapped
5. *Self-Verifying*: Aletheia can verify itself

== Security

Aletheia is designed with security as a primary concern:

- *No unsafe code*: Zero `unsafe` blocks in the entire codebase
- *No dependencies*: Eliminates supply chain attack surface
- *No network access*: Cannot exfiltrate data or download malicious code
- *Symlink detection*: Prevents directory traversal attacks
- *Minimal attack surface*: ~810 lines of auditable Rust code
- *Security disclosure*: See link:SECURITY.md[SECURITY.md] and link:.well-known/security.txt[.well-known/security.txt]
- *Security audit*: Last audited 2025-12-26, zero vulnerabilities found
