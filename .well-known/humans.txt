/* PHILOSOPHY */

"Aletheia" (ἀλήθεια) - Ancient Greek
Meaning: Truth, disclosure, unconcealment

Not merely factual correctness, but the revealing or
unconcealing of reality. In software, this means:

- Transparent processes
- Verifiable standards
- Honest documentation
- Clear communication
- Rigorous verification

"The truth is not always beautiful,
 nor beautiful words the truth." - Lao Tzu
