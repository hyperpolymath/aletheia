## Philosophy
# We embrace AI as a tool for human augmentation, not replacement.
# AI should help developers learn, create, and verify - while humans
# retain responsibility, creativity, and ethical judgment.
#
# In the spirit of *alētheia* (truth), we encourage transparent disclosure
# of AI-assisted contributions while maintaining human accountability.
