# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Security warning system**: Three-level warning system (Info, Warning, Critical)
- **Symlink detection**: Detects symlinks and warns if they escape repository bounds
- **Verification timestamps**: ISO 8601 UTC timestamp in output (TOCTOU mitigation)
- **README.adoc support**: Accepts AsciiDoc README as alternative to Markdown
- **ROADMAP.md**: Comprehensive roadmap from MVP to v10.0.0
- **PRIORITIES.md**: MoSCoW prioritization document

### Changed

- Consistent 16-check count regardless of .well-known directory existence
- Critical symlink warnings now cause verification failure
- Updated SECURITY.md with accurate threat model
- Updated MAINTAINERS.md with actual maintainer information

### Security

- **Security Audit**: Conducted 2025-12-26, zero vulnerabilities found
- Removed false "large files" limitation from SECURITY.md (we don't read file contents)
- Added symlink escape detection to prevent directory traversal

### Fixed

- Self-verification now passes (was 76.9%, now 100%)
- Integration tests updated to match actual check count
- Removed unused code warnings

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-22

### Added

- **Initial release** of Aletheia RSR compliance verification tool
- **Core verification engine** for RSR Bronze-level compliance
- **Documentation checks**: README.md, LICENSE.txt, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, MAINTAINERS.md, CHANGELOG.md
- **Well-known directory checks**: `.well-known/security.txt`, `.well-known/ai.txt`, `.well-known/humans.txt`
- **Build system checks**: justfile, flake.nix, .gitlab-ci.yml
- **Source structure checks**: src/ directory, tests/ directory
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 5 unit tests with 100% pass rate
- **Zero dependencies**: Only uses Rust standard library
- **Offline-first**: No network calls, works completely air-gapped
- **Type safety**: Full Rust compile-time guarantees, zero unsafe blocks
- **Memory safety**: Rust ownership model, no manual memory management
- **Complete documentation**:
  - README.md with quick start guide
  - SECURITY.md with vulnerability disclosure policy
  - CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md with community standards
  - MAINTAINERS.md with governance structure
  - CHANGELOG.md (this file)
- **.well-known directory**:
  - security.txt (RFC 9116 compliant)
  - ai.txt (AI training policies)
  - humans.txt (human attribution)
- **Build automation**:
  - justfile with 20+ recipes
  - flake.nix for Nix reproducible builds
  - .gitlab-ci.yml for CI/CD pipeline
- **Dual licensing**: MIT + Palimpsest v0.8
- **TPCF Perimeter 3**: Community Sandbox - fully open contribution
- **RSR self-verification**: Aletheia verifies its own RSR compliance

### Design Decisions

- **Single-file implementation**: All code in `src/main.rs` for easy auditing (~300 lines)
- **Zero unsafe code**: No `unsafe` blocks anywhere in the codebase
- **Explicit error handling**: All errors handled with `Result` and `Option`
- **Minimal attack surface**: No dependencies = no supply chain vulnerabilities
- **Clear output**: Human-readable compliance report with emoji indicators

```

### Known Limitations

- **Bronze-level only**: Only checks Bronze-level compliance (Silver/Gold/Platinum planned)
- **No JSON output**: Only human-readable output (JSON format planned)
- **No custom checks**: Cannot define custom verification rules (planned)
- **Single repository**: Cannot batch-analyze multiple repositories (planned)
